    <!--Pitch Black-->
    <p>
      <strong>Pitch Black</strong> is a
      <em>(currently incomplete)</em> expansion mod for
      <strong>Rain World</strong> that's been in development for a little over a
      year by me—Lurzard—and my friends on the
      <strong>Pitch Black Dev Team</strong>. It's part of its unique AU
      <em>(Alternate Universe)</em> That manipulates pre-established lore for
      Rain World and its DLC to tell a new story.

    <!--BETA-->
    <p>
      The current <strong>[BETA]</strong> of <strong>Pitch Black</strong> was
      made public way earlier in development and is available for people who
      want to look at the experience <em>now</em> and see what to expect in the
      <em>finished version</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it's just something for us to build off of,
      <em>feedback is appreciated!</em> It has two new Slugcats with unique
      abilities and mechanics, a custom nighttime-looking world with new
      creatures for it, new threat themes for every explorable region, a cute
      new overseer to guide you, some <em><strong>tiny</strong></em> lore
      changes, and more.
