    <!--Overview-->
    <p>
      <strong>Pitch Black</strong> is a
      <em>(currently incomplete)</em> expansion mod for
      <strong>Rain World</strong> that's been in development for a little over a
      year by me—Lurzard—and my friends on the
      <strong>Pitch Black Dev Team</strong>. It's part of its unique AU
      <em>(Alternate Universe)</em> That manipulates pre-established lore for
      Rain World and its DLC to tell a new story.

    <p>
      The current <strong>[BETA]</strong> of <strong>Pitch Black</strong> was
      made public way earlier in development and is available for people who
      want to look at the experience <em>now</em> and see what to expect in the
      <em>finished mod</em>, though it's just something for us to build off of.
      Feedback is appreciated!
