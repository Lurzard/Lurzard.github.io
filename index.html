        <strong>Pitch Black</strong> is a
        <em>(currently incomplete)</em> expansion mod for
        <strong>Rain World</strong> that's been in development for a little over
        a year by me—Lurzard—and my friends on the
        <strong>Pitch Black Dev Team</strong>. It's part of its unique AU
        <em>(Alternate Universe)</em> That manipulates pre-established lore for
        Rain World and its DLC to tell a new story.

        The current <strong>[BETA]</strong> of <strong>Pitch Black</strong> was
        made public way earlier in development and is available for people who
        want to look at the experience <em>now</em> and see what to expect in
        the <em>finished version</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though it's just something for us to build off of,
        <em>feedback is appreciated!</em> It has two new Slugcats with unique
        abilities and mechanics, a custom nighttime-looking world with new
        creatures for it, new threat themes for every explorable region, a cute
        new overseer to guide you, some <em><strong>tiny</strong></em> lore
        changes, and more.

          Although small, they have some powerful tactics involving their
          electrical nature. With the use of their electric saliva, advanced
          weaponry of spears can be made at the cost of food.</em
