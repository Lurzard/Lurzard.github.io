        Pitch Black is a <dfn title="Work In Progress">WIP</dfn> expansion mod
        for <strong>Rain World</strong> that's been in development for a little
        over a year by the <strong>Pitch Black Dev Team</strong>. It is part of
        an <dfn title="Alternate Universe">AU</dfn> that manipulates
        pre-established lore for Rain World and its DLC to tell a new story.

        The current <strong>[BETA]</strong> of <strong>Pitch Black</strong> was
        made public way earlier in development and is available for people who
        want to look at the experience <em>now</em> and see what to expect in
        the <em>finished version</em>.

        Though it's just something for us to build off of,
        <em>feedback is appreciated!</em> It has two new Slugcats with unique

        We've made the decision to <em>stop updating</em> the
        <strong>[BETA]</strong>'s workshop page with new content as it's being
        developed more, instead we are going to re-release the mod when
        finished. Testing of content and features in the mod are still needed so
        we're doing playtesting with volunteers in the mod's discord.
