    <!--Overview-->
    <p>
      Pitch Black is a (currently incomplete) expansion mod that's been in
      development for a little over a year by me—Lurzard—and my friends on the
      Pitch Black Dev Team, adding two new custom campaigns. Its world is part
      of an AU (Alternate Universe) That manipulates pre-established lore for
      Rain World and its DLC to tell a new story.
